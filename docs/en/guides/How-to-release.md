Apache SkyWalking release guide
--------------------
This document guides every committer to release SkyWalking in Apache Way,
and also help committers to check the release for vote.


## Setup your development environment
Follow [Apache maven deployment environment document](http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#dev-env)
to set gpg tool and encrypt passwords

Use the following block as a template and place it in ~/.m2/settings.xml

```
<settings>
...
  <servers>
    <!-- To publish a snapshot of some part of Maven -->
    <server>
      <id>apache.snapshots.https</id>
      <username> <!-- YOUR APACHE LDAP USERNAME --> </username>
      <password> <!-- YOUR APACHE LDAP PASSWORD (encrypted) --> </password>
    </server>
    <!-- To stage a release of some part of Maven -->
    <server>
      <id>apache.releases.https</id>
      <username> <!-- YOUR APACHE LDAP USERNAME --> </username>
      <password> <!-- YOUR APACHE LDAP PASSWORD (encrypted) --> </password>
    </server>
   ...
  </servers>
</settings>
```

## Add your GPG public key
1. Add your GPG public key into [SkyWalking GPG KEYS](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/skywalking/KEYS) file,
only if you are a committer, use your Apache id and password login this svn, and update file. **Don't override the existing file.**
1. Upload your GPG public key to public GPG site. Such as [MIT's site](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/). This site should be in 
Apache maven staging repository check list.

## Test your settings
This step is only for test, if your env is set right, don't need to check every time.
```
./mvnw clean install -Papache-release (this will build artifacts, sources and sign)
```

## Prepare the release
```
./mvnw release:clean
./mvnw release:prepare -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -Pauto-submodule
```
_You could do a GPG sign before doing release, if you need input the password to sign, and the maven don't give the chance,
but just failure. Run `gpg --sign xxx` to any file could remember the password for enough time to do release._ 

## Stage the release 
```
./mvnw release:perform -DskipTests -Pauto-submodule
```
1. Set version number as x.y.z, and tag as **v**x.y.z (version tag must start with **v**, you will find the purpose in next step.)
1. The release will automatically be inserted into a temporary staging repository for you.

## Build and sign the source code package
```shell
export RELEASE_VERSION=x.y.z (example: RELEASE_VERSION=5.0.0-alpha)
cd tools/releasing
sh create_source_release.sh
```

**NOTICE**, `create_source_release.sh` is just suitable for MacOS. Welcome anyone to contribute Windows bat and Linux shell. 

This scripts should do following things
1. Use `v` + `RELEASE_VERSION` as tag to clone the codes.
1. Make `git submodule init/update` done.
1. Exclude all unnecessary files in the target source tar, such as .git, .github, .gitmodules. See the script for the details.
1. Do `gpg` and `shasum 512`. 


The `apache-skywalking-apm-incubating-x.y.z-src.tgz` should be found in `tools/releasing` folder,
with .asc, .sha512.

## Find and download distribution in Apache Nexus Staging repositories
1. Use ApacheId to login `https://repository.apache.org/`
1. Go to `https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories`
1. Search `skywalking` and find your staging repository
1. Close the repository and wait for all checks pass. In this step, your GPG KEYS will be checked. See [set PGP document](#add-your-gpg-public-key),
if you haven't done it before.
1. Go to `{REPO_URL}/org/apache/skywalking/apache-skywalking-apm-incubating/x.y.z`
1. Download `.tar.gz` and `.zip` with .asc and .sha1


## Upload to Apache svn
1. Use ApacheId to login `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/skywalking/`
1. Create folder, named by release version and round, such as: x.y.z
1. Upload Source code package to the folder with .asc, .sha512
    * Package name: apache-skywalking-incubating-x.y.z-src.tar.gz
    * See Section "Build and sign the source code package" for more details 
1. Upload distribution package to the folder with .asc, .sha512
    * Package name: apache-skywalking-incubating-x.y.z.tar.gz, apache-skywalking-incubating-x.y.z.zip
    * See Section "Find and download distribution in Apache Nexus Staging repositories" for more details
    * Create .sha512 package: `shasum -a 512 file > file.sha512`

## Make the internal announcements
Send an announcement mail in dev mail list.

=====
*Disclaimer*

Apache SkyWalking (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The
Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache
Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted
projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have
stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF
projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection
of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate
that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
```

7. Update website download page. http://skywalking.apache.org/downloads/ . Include new download source, distribution, sha512, asc and document
links. Links could be found by following above rules(3)-(6).
8. Add an release event on website homepage and even page. Announce the public release with changelog or key features.
